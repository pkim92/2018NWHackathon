## Introduction

Hack Our City was a two-day hackathon event hosted by Amazon Vancouver, Translink, and the City of New Westminster. I had the privilege to participate in this event with colleagues from BCIT: Jeff, Tomson and Jon on Feb 25 ~ 26th, 2018. With the topic of Planning and Seamless Mobility, Congestion Solutions and Safety and Accessibility, this event provided the opportunity for me to work in an agile development enrivonment, and put my technical knowledge into a solving real-world problems. Together we created a prototype web app named Bike2Go, which incorporates the ideas of previously existing and successful services Uber and Waze.
